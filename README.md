# Decrypting Q
These are tools written in python used for decryption of Q posts, Trump tweets, and more inspired by methods from u/SerialBrain2

## Covfefe method
The program will prompt you for a text input. It will convert all characters to lower case and remove spaces. It will then prompt you for the key and then
output the rest. Make sure to include 'words' in the folder with the program
so it can use the dictionary function to find words in the output.

## Goose method
Like duck duck goose. Enter text at prompt. It will not remove spaces or 
convert to lower case. If key entered is 'd', the keycode is 4, and will grab
and display every 4th letter from the entered text. Dictionary will find words
if there are not unscrambled. Working to use regular expressions (regex) to 
figure this part out. Work in progress.
