# Decrypting Q
These are tools written in python used for decryption of Q posts, Trump tweets, and more inspired by methods from u/SerialBrain2

## Covfefe method
The program will prompt you for a text input. It will convert all characters to lower case and remove spaces. It will then prompt you for the key and then
output the rest. Make sure to include 'words' in the folder with the program
so it can use the dictionary function to find words in the output.

## Goose method
Like duck duck goose. Enter text at prompt. It will not remove spaces or 
convert to lower case. If key entered is 'd', the keycode is 4, and will grab
and display every 4th letter from the entered text. Dictionary will find words
if there are not unscrambled. Working to use regular expressions (regex) to 
figure this part out. Work in progress.

## Installation
On the Github repository main page (https://github.com/controlthruphysics/DecodingQ) click on the green button near the top 
right that says "Clone or download". It should give you a dropdown box where you can click "Download ZIP". This will download
all files from this repository to your hard drive, likely to a Download folder somewhere. Locate this folder, and use any 
program of your choosing to 'unzip' the zip file. www.7zip.org/download.html is a free option if you do not have an unzip tool.
The unzip program will ask where you want the files extracted to. Put them in a new folder or somewhere easy to find. Once the
files have been extracted, simply go into that folder and click on either covfefe.py or goose.py to run the programs.
